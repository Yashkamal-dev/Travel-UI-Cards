# React Cards Practice Project

This is a small React project built to practice creating reusable components and implementing modern CSS effects like hover animations and backdrop blur.  
The project is **not production-level**, but it's a fun playground to explore React, CSS Grid, and interactive UI elements.

---

## Features

- **Reusable Card Component**: Each card displays an image, title, description, price, and additional info.
- **Hover Effects**: Smooth lift and scale animation on hover.
- **Backdrop Blur on Info**: Card information has a blur effect for a modern UI feel.
- **Responsive Layout**: Cards are arranged using CSS Grid for a clean layout.
- **Custom Styling**: Rounded corners, shadows, and subtle animations.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - for building reusable components
- **CSS Grid** - for layout
- **CSS Transitions & Transform** - for hover animations
- **Backdrop Filter** - for blur effects on card info

## Notes

- This project was mainly for **practice**, so features are minimal.
- Hover animations and blur effects were added to **explore interactive UI techniques**.
- Cards are easily **extendable** to any dataset.
